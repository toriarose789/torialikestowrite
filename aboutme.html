       <p><i>I am Victoria Rose Lane</i>. I was born and raised in the land of <b>Pueblo Chilies</b>.. From a young age my life was filled with imagination and tea. Growing up I spent my time at the Orman- Adam’s Mansion, drinking tea and eating scones at the tea house my mom and Mimi owned. My sister, Alexsondria and I would frolic through the yard and mansion, using every ounce of our imagination. When I wasn’t playing, I was helping my family with various tea parties, Alice in Wonderland, Fairy Teas, and then everyone’s favorite, Tea with Santa.  Bennett Drive is where I spent my childhood years.  Some of my favorite memories are housed at Bennett. Mom and Mimi painted our bedroom with flowers and fairies, hiding and playing along the walls. The best part of Bennett was the playhouse that my cousin had built. It was an adorable purple and pink, painted with a hat on the floor. Many warm summer nights we could be found here, staying up all night laughing. On hot summer days, my sister and I would race down the short street, stop and eat mulberries right of my neighbor’s tree. During the rainy season, my sister and I would sit and watch the boys down the street playing in the flooded rain water. God forbid Alexsondria and I were even allowed to get close to that. Funny to think as an adult I drive right through the flood water.</p> 

	<p>As a kid I learned what loss was pretty quick. Growing up with all four sets of great grandparents can be a blessing and a curse. Many of my fondest memories are with them. My great grandpa and Grandma Schiro lived in this adorable little trailer park. Behind their home was the garden. It was small but was it beautiful. My grandpa had the greenest thumb of anyone you would ever meet. Everything grew, no matter what. My favorite was the giant peach tree, that grew out of sheer spite and resilience. They were those delicious juice drip down your face peaches.  My Grandpa Newman was one of the funniest people one could ever meet. As a child he would sing to us this song, that is definitely not something that should have been taught to a child.  While at his and Grandma Helen’s house my sister and I would play with these little wind up toys, many of them should have been in the wind up toy museum.  Grandma Lane was a great lady, but it makes me really sad that I can’t remember much about her. I remember trick or treating and them visiting sometimes but its hard it find a concrete memory of her.  Grandpa Lane would always take the family to Cracker Barrel for breakfast, and after breakfast he would let us go and buy some little trinket in the store.</p>
	<p>Out of all my great grandparents, I have the most memories of Grandma Hellen. She passed away my Junior year of college. Her passing probably was the hardest one for me. Every Thursday I would go and have lunch with her. I’d sit for hours and listen to her stories, share Mexican food. Sometimes we’d go down to the lunch room, those little old people and their clicks were just as bad as those in high school. When she passed we were treated like the ugly step children, which in a sense that’s exactly what we were. Being referred to as the “other family,” in a manner that seemed to leave a bad taste in their mouth is something I will always remember.My sophomore year we moved to the Dittmer house, which was Grandma Helen and Grandpa Newman’s house.  Its weird looking back at memories of when they lived there to now, and how the house doesn’t even seem the same.</p>
