    <h3>Introducing Victoria Rose Lane</h3>
    <p1><b>My name is Victoria Rose Lane.</b> I am studying Creative Writing with a minor in Mass Communications at CSUP. I have interest in writing poetry and fiction pieces. When Iâ€™m not writing I am spending my time hiking and enjoying nature. I love to travel and being on the road. Car rides are my favorite way to see the world. I also enjoy spending time reading and enjoying a nice calm weekend. A lot of my work is based off of travels and other life experiences.</p1>
